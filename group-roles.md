Example Group Project Roles
===========================

All of you will be responsible for building this project together, and you should expect to spend a significant amount of time working on every part of the app: planning, back-end and front-end.

This means that in a group of three or four members, the group *should not* work on more than two tasks at a given time. You are expected to pair. Your job is not to produce code, but to produce a product! Even if a pair member on a front-end task doesn't feel able to contribute to code, they will contribute to code quality and idea generation.

However, in addition to your shared responsibility to deliver the finished product, you may also each have accountability roles. Assuming these roles and responsibilities are *optional* and the assignment of roles is up to your group. A different division of accountability may work better for you.
 
**Note:** No one is responsible for their roles, but they are accountable for their roles.

The suggested roles and duties are:

- **Project Lead/Product Lead:** Accountable for team meetings, team progress, and time management. Also accountable for team decisions on product features, scope, and timeline.

- **Front-End Lead:** Accountable for team decisions on front-end implementation strategy and front-end dependencies and tools. Also accountable for front-end execution.

- **Back-End Lead:** Accountable for team decisions on back-end implementation strategy and back-end dependencies and tools. Also accountable for back-end execution.

- **Quality Assurance:** Accountable for code quality through frequent pair-programming and code review. Also accountable for proper use of Git (commit messages, branching/merging strategies) throughout the project. If your group only has three members, everyone is jointly and individually accountable for quality.

To be absolutely clear, this does not mean that the person assigned the back-end role will be performing all of the tasks on the back-end, and never look at CSS or JavaScript. Rather, this person is the tie-breaker for decisions about how the back-end will be implemented (perhaps by other group members), and accountable for ensuring that the work that is performed is done well, even if that member is not doing the work themselves.

For example, if Tom, Jason and Anna were working in a group and Anna was the back-end lead: Tom and Jason might be trying to figure out the best way to implement a set of model associations and can’t come to a decision, they go to Anna and she will talk to each and help make the decision for which type of association will be used. It is entirely possible that Anna doesn’t actually do the coding for that feature at all.

In another example, Jeff, Matt and David are working in a group and David is the project-lead: David proposes that the team uses Asana, Jeff proposes Basecamp, and Matt doesn’t really seem to care. David talks to Jeff about it to find out why he prefers it, and decides they will use Basecamp despite not proposing such himself.

In a final example, Jeff, Matt and David are working in a group and Matt is the back-end lead: Jeff has been working on some RSpec tests and their implementation for some models in Rails to fulfill a feature. Matt notices that the RSpec tests leave a lot of holes and there are some weird variable names being used in the implementation. While things work, they could be done better. Matt helps Jeff by doing a code review with him and then pairs to refactor some of the test and model implementations. Now Matt feels like the back-end is back on track for success for the next steps in the project.

These roles aren’t your jobs in the group; rather they are simply something you are more mindful of and accountable for while you work as a team to build a great project.
